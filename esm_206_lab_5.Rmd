```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Objectives:

- Getting counts for different groups
- Use {lubridate} to parse dates
- Find confidence intervals & do t-tests with t.test()
- Heatmap with geom_tile()

```{r, include = FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)

```

```{r}
# Import Lobster Data #

lobster_abundance <- read_csv(here::here("data","lobster_abundance.csv"),
                              na = "-99999") %>% 
  clean_names()
```

Use the dplyr:: tidyr() function to expand a frequency variable
```{r}
lobster_tidy <- lobster_abundance %>%
  tidyr::uncount(lobster_count)
```

Yay! Now each lobster has its own row. This is tidy format.
```{r}

```
